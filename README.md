# Gauthic

A helper library for building and fetching Google OAuth tokens in Service Account based flows.

Uses [HTTPact](https://github.com/zblanco/httpact) for HTTP Requests instead of depending on a concrete HTTP Client.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `gauthic` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do

end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
